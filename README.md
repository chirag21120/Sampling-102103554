# Sampling-102103554
This project investigates the impact of different sampling techniques on the performance of machine learning models.
Sampling plays a crucial role in handling imbalanced datasets and ensuring model generalization.
In this project, we explore five common sampling techniques and evaluate their effects on five popular machine learning models.
